#include "logger.h"
#include "core/infrastructure/logger/logger.h"

// This file provides the implementation for the logger system
// The actual logging is done through macros defined in logger.h
// This file exists to maintain consistency with the project structure

// Future implementations could include:
// - Log levels
// - Log rotation
// - Remote logging
// - Structured logging (JSON)
// - Performance metrics

// For now, all functionality is in the header file as macros
